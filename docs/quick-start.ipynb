    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a directory for your databases** (if you don't have one already). Replace `/path/to/your/databases/` with your preferred location:\n",

    "    mkdir -p /path/to/your/databases/kraken2_dbs\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    This will create a directory named `k2_minusb_20250402` (or similar, depending on the archive structure) inside `/path/to/your/databases/kraken2_dbs/`. The actual database files (`hash.k2d`, `opts.k2d`, `taxo.k2d`) will be within this extracted folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Update MicroCAT's configuration to point to this database:**\n",
    "    Make sure to use the path to the directory *containing* the database files (e.g., `/path/to/your/databases/kraken2_dbs/k2_minusb_20250402`).\n",

    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "**c. (Optional) Download Cluster Profiles:**\n",
    "If you plan to run MicroCAT on a cluster (e.g., Slurm, LSF, SGE), download the relevant Snakemake profile:\n",
